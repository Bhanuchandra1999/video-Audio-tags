            <summary>Episode 1</summary><p>            This is much more than just some cartoon/anime and it’s much more than just ninja kids in a ninja world. The real story behind Naruto is the reality of our world and how real people grow up: through pain, suffering, love, commitments, hope, passion. This anime has a way of truly bringing their characters to life and you can’t help but cry several times in this series, even happy tears. Naruto is truly the epitome of a hero, not just because he is the main protagonist and he saves the day, but it’s his unrelenting heart, his pure, raw passion and his unflinching sense of knowing what’s right from wrong despite whether he goes against everyone. He’s loud, he’s brash, he’s a hothead who grows wiser, smarter, and so much more. He’s the kind of hero that inspires, not only the characters in the show, but in turn us, the viewers, as well.</p>
